# rock-paper-scissors

This is a multipart project. 
For the first part using the console the user can play against the computer rock paper scissors where the winner is declared for a max of 5 rounds.

For the second part I created updated game where the player selections rocks, paper or scissors via a picture instead of a prompt. This was achieved by manipulating the DOM using JavaScript and Node.js to set up the game conditions and add an interactive element to the page.

The project as a whole taught me how to create a branch and merge the finished project so that I can test new features before implimenting them.
