# üéÆ Rock Paper Scissors Clone
This is a multipart project creating a rock paper scissors clone for the Odin Project coursework.
For the first part using the console the user can play against the computer rock paper scissors where the winner is declared for a max of 5 rounds.
For the second part I created updated game where the player selections rocks, paper or scissors via a picture instead of a prompt. This was achieved by manipulating the DOM using JavaScript and Node.js to set up the game conditions and add an interactive element to the page.
The project as a whole taught me how to create a branch and merge the finished project so that I can test new features before implementing them. (Which I still broke the second time...) After feedback I added a visual clue on what the computer played which broke my buttons using a .svg so I switched to emoji. Displaying the results using words also didn't work with how I set up the functions. Trying to save space they didn't have the flexibility to show all results just win, lose and tie. I then changed the colour scheme to blue and grey instead of blue and white to match my other projects. I then changed the refresh button to popup instead of of a clickable button to match my minesweeper format I've been fond of.
