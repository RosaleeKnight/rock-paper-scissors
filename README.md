# rock-paper-scissors

This is a multipart project. 
For the first part using the console the user can play against the computer rock paper scissors where the winner is declared for a max of 5 rounds.

For the second part I created updated game where the player selections rocks, paper or scissors via a picture instead of a prompt. This was achieved by manipulating the DOM using JavaScript and Node.js to set up the game conditions and add an interactive element to the page.

The project as a whole taught me how to create a branch and merge the finished project so that I can test new features before implementing them. (Which I still broke the second time...) After feedback I added a visual clue on what the computer played which broke my buttons using a .svg so I switched to emoji. Displaying the results using words also didn't work with how I set up the functions. Trying to save space they didn't have the flexibility to show all results just win, lose and tie. I then changed the colour scheme to blue and grey instead of blue and white to match my other projects. I then changed the refresh button to popup instead of of a clickable button to match my minesweeper format I've been fond of.
