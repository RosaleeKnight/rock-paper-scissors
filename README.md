# rock-paper-scissors

This is a multipart project. 
For the first part using the console the user can play against the computer rock paper scissors where the winner is declared for a max of 5 rounds.

For the second part I created a game where the player selections an icon via a picture instead of a prompt. Manipulation the DOM using JavaScript and Node.js 
I set up the game conditions and added an interactive element to the page.
